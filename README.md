# Man on a Ledge Registration
##

This will be the software used to run tournament registration at Man on a Ledge events. This original version will cater to MoaL specifically but future plans are to create a PMoaL event and eventually a dynamic version to be used at any tournament.  This would include dynamic number of events, setting prices. setting registration deadlines and picking their own photos.
